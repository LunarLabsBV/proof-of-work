Causality is circular as proven by the Gott-Time Machine and the direction of time can be measured. There is a strong CTC presence. Two Frames of Reference seem to respect causality since they are bounded in local space, they converge "converger" to an immediate linearized landscape. Over relativistic scales an event can occur before it occurs from one frame of reference with respect to another. It is as if the message reaches the client before the server presses the button to send the message. Imagine this scenario over two frames of reference. A happens before A happened in F1. That is, A precedes B in F1 whereas B precedes A in F2.
