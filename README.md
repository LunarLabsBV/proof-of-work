# proof-of-work
Causality is circular as proven by the Gott-Time Machine and the direction of time can be measured. There is a strong CTC presence. Two Frames of Reference seem to respect causality since they are bounded in local space. Over relativistic scales an event can occur before it occurs from one frame of reference with respect to another.
